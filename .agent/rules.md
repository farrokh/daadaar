# Agent Rules

## Git Workflow
- Always `git pull origin main` after a merge is completed.
- Ensure the local workspace is fully updated with the merged changes before deleting any local branches.
- Never delete a branch (local or remote) until confirmation of a successful merge into the base branch.
